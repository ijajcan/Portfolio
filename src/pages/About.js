          Hi, I'm <span>Ivan Jajcan</span>
        </h1>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a software developer and designer with over 4 years of experience
          of developing and designing new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each project, I aim to push boundaries, combining creativity and
          functionality to enhance the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gym is my happy place, where I recharge and stay grounded, and I
          bring that energy back into my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both my fitness routine and my programming career, knowledge and
          determination are essential to success. Just as I train with a focus
          on consistency and progress, I approach design and development with
          the same dedication, sculpting every detail to build solutions that
          are efficient, functional, and enjoyable to use.
